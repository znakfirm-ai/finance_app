# Business Rules

## Balance & Income Sources
- Income sources (`Доходы` in the mini app) are **analytics-only**.
- Income sources **must not** affect the overall balance.
- Overall balance is computed only from account operations.

## Internal Transfers
- Transfers between the user's own “pockets” (e.g., account ↔ goal) are internal.
- Internal transfers **must not** affect the overall balance.
- Internal transfers **do** affect account balances.
